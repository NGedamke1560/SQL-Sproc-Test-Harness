# SQL-Sproc-Test-Harness
A collection of tools that I used as a consultant to measure performance improvements after optimizing stored procedures. 

Also includes a tool to check that the output of both proc versions match, ensuring that performance tuning has not introduced logical bugs.

Probably best summarized by OpenAI's ChatGPT:
  "It's a test harness for comparing the results of two stored procedures...
   It's a bit of a mess, but it does the job."
